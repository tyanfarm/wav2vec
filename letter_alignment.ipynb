    "2) **Leading-silent letters (liaison/elision)**: If the first letter(s) of a word have **no corresponding phoneme** due to cross-word coarticulation (e.g., “out together” pronounced without /t/ at the start of “together”), attach those leading letters to the **first phoneme chunk of the same word**, not to the previous word.\n",
    "3) **Maximal contiguity inside each word**: Within a word, each \"letter\" value must be a **contiguous substring** of that word and chunks must be **greedy forward** so that concatenating all \"letter\" fields of that word (in order) exactly reconstructs the original spelling of that word (case preserved).\n",
    "4) **No cross-word borrowing for clean-up**: If something doesn't map, you may merge with the **previous phoneme or previous letter only within the same word**. Do **not** use a phoneme/letter from the previous word to fix the next word, and vice versa.\n",

    "Coverage/validation:\n",
    "- Every non-space character from the original Text (including punctuation such as apostrophes ’, hyphens -, diacritics, etc.) must appear in at least one \"letter\" field of **its own word**.\n",
    "- The concatenation of all \"letter\" fields across the whole output (including the empty entries for spaces) must equal the original Text exactly.\n",

Text is \"february\\'s sale\". Two words: \"february\\'s\" and \"sale\". Phoneme string: \"fɛbjuwɛɹiseɪl\". Need to split into two contiguous segments corresponding to each word, preserving exactly.\\n\\nWe need to figure segmentation. Let\\'s parse phonemes: f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i s e ɪ l ? Wait actual string: \"fɛbjuwɛɹiseɪl\". Let\\'s list characters: f, ɛ, b, j, u, w, ɛ, ɹ, i, s, e, ɪ, l. That\\'s 13 symbols.\\n\\nWord \"february\\'s\": likely pronounced /ˈfɛbjuːˌɛriːz/ or something. But note the phoneme string: fɛbjuwɛɹi s eɪl? Actually \"sale\" is /seɪl/. The later part \"seɪl\" corresponds to sale phonemes: s e ɪ l. Indeed we have \"...s eɪl\" but we see \"seɪl\" in string at the end: the substring \"seɪl\"? Our string has \"...seɪl\". Let\\'s examine: after \"...ɹi\" we have \"seɪl\". So \"ɹi\" may be part of february\\'s: the \"ri\" sound. And \"w\" may be semivowel? Let\\'s split: \"february\\'s\" likely: f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i s? Actually february\\'s \"february\\'s\": /ˈfɛb.ju.ɛ.riz/ maybe includes a \"w\"? In this phoneme string we have \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\". Then maybe the \"\\'s\" adds an \"z\"? Wait we have after \"ɹi\" there is \"s\". The string after \"ɹi\" is \"s eɪl\". So the \"s\" could be the possessive \"s\" of february\\'s, and the remaining \"eɪl\" is for \"sale\". But we still have \"w\" semivowel after \"ju\". So segmentation: Word1: \"february\\'s\" => phonemes: fɛbjuwɛɹis? Actually include the s? Let\\'s count: for word1 we need from start up to the s before sale: that would be f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i s -> that\\'s 11 symbols: fɛbjuwɛɹis. Word2: \"sale\" => phonemes: eɪl? Wait we need \"seɪl\". The \\'s\\' is used for \"sale\"? Actually sale\\'s initial s is the same as the s we allocated to word1? Let\\'s check the string: f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i s e ɪ l. After the \"i\" is \"s\". If we allocate that \\'s\\' to word2, then word2 would be \"seɪl\": s e ɪ l. So word2\\'s phonemes: seɪl. Then word1 would be fɛbjuwɛɹi (no s). That is \"february\" plus maybe the possessive? But the possessive s would be separate? The text \"february\\'s\" includes the \\'s. So we need to include that s in word1. The \\'s belongs to february\\'s. However if we allocate s to word2, mis-align.\\n\\nBut maybe \"february\\'s\" ends with \"i\" and the \\'s is part of \"sale\"? Actually \"february\\'s sale\": the phrase includes \"february\\'s\" (possessive) then space then \"sale\". So the s of the possessive is part of february\\'s word. So we need to allocate the s to word1, and then \"sale\" would start with \"eɪl\"? But sale requires initial s. Could be that the s is shared? Not allowed.\\n\\nCheck the phoneme string: \"fɛbjuwɛɹiseɪl\". If we separate as:\\n\\nWord1: \"february\\'s\" => \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\". Wait that lacks the s. Word2: \"sale\" => \"seɪl\" (s eɪl) includes s. So we would be missing the possessive s. Could be that the possessive s is realized as a zero or merged with the following s of sale? In speech, \"February\\'s sale\" may have linking where the s attaches to following s? Actually \"February\\'s sale\" might be pronounced with a single /z/ after february then /s/ for sale: februaryz sale. But phoneme string does not include z, only \"s\". So maybe the possessive s is pronounced /z/ but not present? But we cannot guess.\\n\\nGiven the constraint: not to change characters, we must assign contiguous segments. The only valid split is:\\n\\n- Word1: \"february\\'s\" => \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\"\\n- Word2: \"sale\" => \"seɪl\"\\n\\nBut then the s belongs to sale, not february\\'s. That violates word mapping, but maybe that\\'s intended because the s is after space? Actually there is a space: \"february\\'s sale\". The phoneme string doesn\\'t have a pause; continuous. The s after \"i\" is probably the /z/ of possessive merging with the /s/ of sale maybe? However the given phoneme string \"fɛbjuwɛɹiseɪl\" includes \"s\" then \"eɪl\". So the /s/ is likely the initial consonant of \"sale\". So the possessive \\'s\\' maybe is not represented. So we must follow the phoneme string. As per rules, we must map each word to a contiguous segment; we can\\'t insert missing phonemes. So we will map word1 to \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\" and word2 to \"seɪl\". The possessive s will be considered part of \"sale\". But the word list remains as given.\\n\\nThus output JSON:\\n\\n[\\n  {\"word\": \"february\\'s\", \"phonemes\": \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\"},\\n  {\"word\": \"sale\", \"phonemes\": \"seɪl\"}\\n]\\n\\nCheck lengths: combined phonemes: fɛbjuwɛɹi (10?) Let\\'s count: f(1) ɛ2 b3 j4 u5 w6 ɛ7 ɹ8 i9 -> 9? Actually string \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\": characters: f, ɛ, b, j, u, w, ɛ, ɹ, i = 9. Then \"seɪl\": s, e, ɪ, l =4.

Note there is a trailing space in phonemes indicating maybe word-space after sale. We\\'ll need to map.\\n\\nFirst, split text into words including apostrophe s: \"february\\'s\" and \"sale\". The text: f e b r u a r y \\' s   s a l e . Wait there is no period. The text includes the apostrophe s as part of first word: \"february\\'s\". That\\'s five letters plus apostrophe? Actually \"february\\'s\" = f e b r u a r y \\' s (10 characters). Then space, then \"sale\" (4 letters). So total characters 10 + 1(space) + 4 =15.\\n\\nPhoneme string: \"fɛbjuwɛɹi seɪl \" includes a trailing space after \"l\". That likely corresponds to a space after \"sale\". So phoneme sequence: f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i   s e ɪ l (and maybe final space). Let\\'s list:\\n\\nString: \"f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i   s e ɪ l \" (assuming spaces between words). We\\'ll need to treat each phoneme unit. Also treat diphthong/affricate units defined: they include \"oʊ\", \"oʊ̃\", \"əʊ\", \"aʊ\", \"əɹ\", \"ɜɹ\", \"ɔɹ\". Not relevant.\\n\\nWe must treat \"w\" as semivowel that may share letters with next phoneme. Similarly \"j\". In this phoneme string we have a \"j\" (phoneme /j/). Also \"w\". So they may correspond to same letters as preceding/vowel.\\n\\nNow map to word \"february\\'s\". Pronunciation: /ˈfɛb.ju.ɹi/ plus possesive \\'s maybe /z/ or /s/. Wait given phonemes: \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\". That\\'s 9 phonemes: f, ɛ, b, j, u, w, ɛ, ɹ, i. That\\'s \"feb + ju + w? + ɛɹi\". Wait typical \"February\" pronunciations: /ˈfɛb.ju.ɛɹ.i/ maybe /ˈfɛb.ju.ə.ri/. Here they have \"fɛbjuwɛɹi\". That includes \"w\" after u (as glide). So \"juw\" representing \"yu\". So we have letters \"fu\"? Actually \"february\" letters: f e b r u a r y. We need map letters to phonemes.\\n\\nWe\\'ll need contiguous substrings per phoneme chunk across the word. Each word\\'s letters must concatenate to original word respecting order.\\n\\nGoal: For each phoneme, assign a substring (could be multiple letters if they map together) that together reconstruct the word. Must not skip letters; each letter must appear (maybe repeated). The mapping may split letters across phonemes (e.g., \\'a\\' may contribute to both j and u? but they said repeat letters if contribute to multiple phonemes). That often occurs with diphthongs where two vowel phonemes share same letters? Eg \"au\" -> aʊ where \\'a\\' maybe part of a and \\'u\\' part of ʊ? But they said repeat letters as needed. So we can repeat letters.\\n\\nWe need to produce mapping for \"february\\'s\". Let\\'s list letters of this word: f e b r u a r y \\' s . We\\'ll treat apostrophe s as its own letters \"\\'s\". According to rules, contractions attach left, meaning the apostrophe s can map to empty phoneme (no sound) maybe? In example for january\\'s they gave {\"phoneme\":\"\",\"letter\":\"\\'s\"} after aligning \"i\" of \"y\". So they treat the possessive \\'s as a separate entry with empty phoneme. So we need to do same.\\n\\nThus we will have after aligning the phonemes for \"february\", we add an entry with phoneme \"\" and letter \"\\'s\". Then a space entry {\"phoneme\":\"\",\"letter\":\"\"}. Then mapping for \"sale\": s e ɪ l? Actually phoneme list after space: \"seɪl\". \\'s\\' \\'eɪ\\' \\'l\\' plus maybe \"?\" No \"e\" separate? Wait \"seɪl\": s + eɪ + l . So phonemes: s, eɪ (diphthong), l. But the phoneme string shows \"seɪl\". That is s + eɪ + l. Also there is leading space before s. So we need an entry for space. So after space marker, we will map \"s\" to letter \"s\". Then \"eɪ\" to \"a\". Then \"l\" to \"le\"? Actually \"sale\": s a l e. Usually pronunciation \"seɪl\": /seɪl/. So \"eɪ\" corresponds to \"a\". Then \"l\" corresponds to \"l\". The \"e\" silent but appears in spelling; we need to map it somewhere. Usually \"e\" at end is silent; per rule we cannot drop letters. Should attach to a phoneme, perhaps the final \"l\" because sometimes final \"e\" doesn\\'t produce sound. We can repeat letters: map \"l\" phoneme to \"le\" (both letters). That uses both l and e.\\n\\nNow need to handle \"february\". Let\\'s map phonemes:\\n\\nWord \"february\": letters: f e b r u a r y\\n\\nPhoneme sequence: f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i\\n\\nWe need to assign substrings.\\n\\nStart: phoneme f -> letter \"f\". Good.\\n\\nphoneme ɛ -> letters \"e\". Good.\\n\\nphoneme b -> letter \"b\". Good.\\n\\nphoneme j -> letter? The /j/ corresponds to \"y\" as a consonantal y? In \"february\", after \"b\" we have \"r\". Wait we have letters \"r\". Actually /j/ is the \"y\" sound as a glide after \"b\". In spelling, the \"r\" maybe part of \"br\". So /j/ may be represented by \"r\"? Actually \"febra\"-? Let\\'s think: \"february\" orthography: febr-u-ary. The \"r\" is pronounced as /r/, not /j/. But the phoneme sequence they gave includes /j/ after b. That might represent the \"r\" merging to /j/? Actually typical: \"February\": /ˈfɛb.juˌɛr.i/. Some dialects have a glide /j/ after b before \\'u\\', like \"feb-ju\". So /j/ could be from the \\'r\\' being silent? But the \\'r\\' in American English maybe pronounced: /ˈfɛb.juˌɛri/. The \\'r\\' after the ju is maybe part of /ɹ/. Wait they have later phoneme ɹ. So there are two r\\'s: one in \\'bru\\' maybe representing /b/ + /j/ with the \\'r\\' not pronounced? Actually spelling \"february\": \\'b\\', \\'r\\', \\'u\\'. The \"br\" cluster may produce /b/. The /j/ may be from the \\'r\\' assimilation? Not sure.\\n\\nNevertheless we need to map letters to phonemes while maintaining contiguity.\\n\\nWe have letters after b: \"r u a r y\". Let\\'s consider mapping:\\n\\n- /j/ could be mapped to \"r\". Possibly \\'r\\' is silent but used to represent glide? Might be okay.\\n\\n- /u/ phoneme maps to \"u\". Good.\\n\\n- /w/ phoneme is a glide after /u/. Could be represented by \"a\"? Actually the diphthong \"ua\" maybe yields /u.w/. The \\'a\\' may produce /w/ as part of \"ua\". In many transcriptions, \"ua\" = /ʊə/ etc. Not exactly.\\n\\n- /ɛ/ after w maybe maps to \"a\"? Wait after w we have \"ɛ\". The next letters are \"a r\". The \"a\" could be vowel /a/ but pronounced /ɛ/ maybe due to stress? So map /ɛ/ to \"a\". Good.\\n\\n- /ɹ/ maps to \"r\". Good.\\n\\n- /i/ maps to \"y\". Good.\\n\\nThus we can assign:\\n\\nf -> \"f\"\\nɛ -> \"e\"\\nb -> \"b\"\\nj -> \"r\" (maybe)\\nu -> \"u\"\\nw -> \"a\" (the \\'a\\')\\nɛ -> \"a\"? Wait we already used \\'a\\' for w. Need another vowel for /ɛ/. Actually we have letters \"r y\". But we need a vowel for /ɛ/. Actually after \\'a\\' we have \\'r\\', then \\'y\\'. Could we map /ɛ/ to \"a\"? Could map both /w/ and /ɛ/ to \"a\" maybe repetition? Not allowed: each phoneme must have its own letter substring (contiguous). But we could have /w/ share letters with next phoneme? It\\'s a semivowel that shares with next phoneme. Rule: [\"w\",\"j\"] are semivowels and typically share letters with the next phoneme in the same word. So /w/ may be combined with following /ɛ/. That means we could map the substring \"a\" to the combined \"wɛ\"? But we need separate entries for each phoneme; still \"w\" may share letters with next phoneme, meaning the same letter(s) may be repeated for both phoneme entries. Eg for \"quiet\": /kw/ share? Not sure. So we could have /w/ letter \"a\", and /ɛ/ also letter \"a\"? But they must be contiguous substrings; they can be same substring repeated (since repeat allowed). That\\'s fine. So we could map /w/ -> \"a\", and /ɛ/ -> \"a\"? However need to keep order: after /u/, we have /w/ then /ɛ/. If we assign both to same letter \"a\", then concatenating letters across phonemes would produce extra repetition causing extra letters beyond original. However rule says if a letter contributes to multiple phonemes, repeat it as needed. So we can repeat \"a\" for both /w/ and /ɛ/. That means the concatenation of letters across phonemes will have duplicate \"a\". But overall after we process all phonemes, the concatenated letters across the word (without duplication?) must reconstruct original word exactly. The rule about concatenating all \"letter\" fields of a word in order must reconstruct the original spelling. If we repeat letters, then concatenated result would have extra letters. However they allow repeating letters when a letter contributes to multiple phonemes. That would cause duplication. But they likely mean that the repeated letters are still counted but the overall concatenation might have duplicates compared to original; but rule 3 says concatenating all \"letter\" fields of that word (in order) exactly reconstructs the original spelling. So duplication not allowed. Therefore we cannot repeat letters; we must allocate each letter uniquely to some phoneme, but if a letter contributes to multiple phonemes we repeat it, which would conflict with rule 3. Actually they said: \"If one letter contributes to multiple phonemes, repeat it as needed.\" That seems to allow duplication, but rule 3 says concatenating all \"letter\" fields of that word must exactly reconstruct the original spelling. Might mean that the repeated letters must be the same characters and will cause duplication, but maybe they consider that the repeated letters are okay because duplication still matches original? No, because original only contains each character once. Repeating would make longer string. So perhaps they intend that repeating is allowed, but then rule 3 would be violated; maybe they intend that you can repeat letters but still overall concatenation should equal original - meaning you can\\'t have extra letters; so repetition should be overlapping? Actually you could assign a letter to adjacent phonemes where the second phoneme\\'s \"letter\" substring starts at the same position as the previous, overlapping, not concatenated. But concatenating substrings (without overlap) would duplicate. So maybe overlapping is allowed? The problem unclear but typical alignment tasks allow each phoneme to map to a substring; overlapping not typical. However example: not provided for repeating. I\\'d assume we must not duplicate letters; repeat means you can assign same letter to multiple phonemes (thus duplication) but that would break rule 3; maybe rule 3 is higher priority. I\\'d go with non-overlapping.\\n\\nThus we need to map letters uniquely.\\n\\nLet\\'s try to assign greedily: Use contiguous substrings, greedily forward.\\n\\nWord \"february\": letters positions:\\n\\n1 f\\n2 e\\n3 b\\n4 r\\n5 u\\n6 a\\n7 r\\n8 y\\n\\nWe have 9 phonemes, so some phonemes may map to empty string? But rule says do not drop phonemes, each must have a letter (or maybe empty for semivowel?). They didn\\'t forbid empty letter for phoneme; but they said each non-space character must appear in at least one letter field. So we could have some phonemes map to empty string, but then letters still appear elsewhere. For semivowel w maybe empty? Usually w will share with next vowel, but could be assigned empty.\\n\\nThus we could map:\\n\\nphoneme f -> \"f\"\\nphoneme ɛ -> \"e\"\\nphoneme b -> \"b\"\\nphoneme j -> \"r\" (the r)\\nphoneme u -> \"u\"\\nphoneme w -> \"\" (empty) (since glide)\\nphoneme ɛ -> \"a\"\\nphoneme ɹ -> \"r\"\\nphoneme i -> \"y\"\\n\\nNow all letters accounted: f e b r u a r y. Indeed each used once. The w phoneme got empty letter, which is allowed? The rule doesn\\'t forbid empty letter for phoneme, only for space markers. It says each non-space character must appear in at least one letter field of its own word. It doesn\\'t require each phoneme to have non-empty letter. So empty is allowed.\\n\\nWe need to ensure contiguity: each \"letter\" field must be contiguous substring of the word. For \"r\" (j) and then \"u\", they are separate substrings and contiguous overall when concatenated. That\\'s fine.\\n\\nNow after that we need entry for apostrophe s: phoneme \"\" , letter \"\\'s\". Then space entry.\\n\\nNow for \"sale\": letters s a l e.\\n\\nPhonemes: s eɪ l (but also there is possibly an empty? Actually \"seɪl\" includes \\'s\\', \\'eɪ\\', \\'l\\'. That\\'s 3 phonemes.\\n\\nWe need to map letters: s -> \"s\". eɪ -> \"a\". l -> \"le\"? but then letters left: \\'l\\' and \\'e\\'. We could map \"l\" to \"l\" and then leftover \"e\" must map somewhere. Maybe we map \"l\" phoneme to \"l\" and have a separate phoneme with empty mapping for \"e\"? But there is no extra phoneme. So we need to incorporate \"e\" with \"l\" entry, like \"le\". That\\'s okay: \"l\" phoneme corresponds to \"le\" substring (contiguous). That uses both l and e. No leftover letters. Good.\\n\\nThus mapping for sale:\\n\\nphoneme s -> \"s\"\\nphoneme eɪ -> \"a\"\\nphoneme l -> \"le\"\\n\\nNow check full concatenation per word:\\n\\nWord february\\'s: concatenating letters in order:\\n\\nf, e, b, r, u, \"\", a, r, y, \"\\'s\" = \"february\\'s\"? Wait we have missing \\'a\\'? Actually we have letters: f e b r u a r y \\'s. Let\\'s reconstruct:\\n\\n- f\\n- e\\n- b\\n- r\\n- u\\n- (empty)\\n- a\\n- r\\n- y\\n- \"\\'s\"\\n\\nCombine: \"february\\'s\"? That\\'s missing an \\'a\\' after \\'u\\'? Wait we have letters positions: after u at position5, we have letter a at position6 which we assigned to ɛ phoneme. So that yields \"februa\". Good. So full string: f e b r u a r y \\'s = \"february\\'s\". Yes we have all.\\n\\nNow we omitted the letter \\'a\\' used after u; but we also have \"a\" accounted. So final string = \"february\\'s\". Good.\\n\\nNow overall concatenated letters including space entry empty letters yields original text \"february\\'s sale\". Let\\'s check order:\\n\\nlist entries:\\n\\n1 f phoneme f\\n2 e phoneme ɛ\\n3 b phoneme b\\n4 r phoneme j\\n5 u phoneme u\\n6 \"\" phoneme w\\n7 a phoneme ɛ\\n8 r phoneme ɹ\\n9 y phoneme i\\n10 \"\\'s\" phoneme \"\" (apostrophe s)\\n11 \"\" phoneme \"\" (space)\\n12 s phoneme s\\n13 a phoneme eɪ\\n14 le phoneme l\\n15 \"\" phoneme \"\"? There is trailing space maybe need extra empty entry? The phoneme string ends with a space, indicating after \"sale\" there is a space (maybe end-of-string). Do we need a final empty entry marker? The example didn\\'t include trailing space after last word, they just may ignore. Usually we could add final empty entry for trailing space. But spec: Insert an empty phoneme/letter pair {\"phoneme\":\"\",\"letter\":\"\"} between words to mark spaces. So only between words. So after \"sale\" there is no following word, trailing space maybe not needed. The given phoneme string includes a trailing space, but we can ignore extra. Probably we need not add.\\n\\nThus final JSON list as objects.\\n\\nNow verify phoneme list order matches given:\\n\\nGiven the phoneme string: \"fɛbjuwɛɹi seɪl \"\\n\\nOur list of phoneme sequence:\\n\\nf\\nɛ\\nb\\nj\\nu\\nw (empty letter)\\nɛ\\nɹ\\ni\\n\"\" (for apostrophe s) Wait apostrophe s has empty phoneme, not included in phoneme string. So we must treat that as separate mapping after i before space, but not represented in the phoneme list. So it\\'s okay.\\n\\nspace marker (empty phoneme) between words.\\n\\ns\\neɪ\\nl\\n\\nThus combined phoneme sequence ignoring empty entries: f ɛ b j u w ɛ ɹ i s eɪ l matches given (the space omitted). Good.\\n\\nNow produce JSON list.\\n\\nLet\\'s construct the objects:\\n\\n[\\n {\"phoneme\":\"f\",\"letter\":\"f\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"ɛ\",\"letter\":\"e\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"b\",\"letter\":\"b\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"j\",\"letter\":\"r\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"u\",\"letter\":\"u\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"w\",\"letter\":\"\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"ɛ\",\"letter\":\"a\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"ɹ\",\"letter\":\"r\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"i\",\"letter\":\"y\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"\",\"letter\":\"\\'s\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"\",\"letter\":\"\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"s\",\"letter\":\"s\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"eɪ\",\"letter\":\"a\"},\\n {\"phoneme\":\"l\",\"letter\":\"le\"}\\n]\\n\\nMake sure JSON syntax correct.'}, 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 27572244636, 'prompt_eval_count': 1243, 'eval_count': 4256}\n",

You are an expert linguist tasked with creating a precise grapheme-to-phoneme alignment for English words. I will provide you with a word and its IPA transcription. You must return a list of pairs, mapping the letter(s) to the sound(s).

The mapping is not always one-to-one.

**Example:**
Word: "apple"
IPA Transcription: "æpəl"
Expected Output:
[("a", "æ"), ("pp", "p"), ("le", "əl")]

**Your Task:**
Now, perform the same alignment for the following input:

Word: "January"
IPA Transcription: "d͡ʒænjuɛɹi"

Provide only the final list as the output.
